;; guix-packaging (aka "guix-packaging.el") provides tools to create and
;; maintain Guix packages quickly and with confidence.


;; Commands
;; ════════

;; `M-x' `guix-packaging-insert-input'
;; ───────────────────────────────────

;;   Prompts for a set of package strings with completion, for example
;;   `ruby@2.7.2', and inserts the corresponding Guix input form such as
;;   `("ruby@2.7.2" ,ruby-2.7)'.

;;   Reads the Guile source code to find the appropriate symbol name, so it
;;   might not work with some packages that have unusual source code.


;; `M-x' `guix-packaging-hash-git'
;; ───────────────────────────────

;;   Saves the Guix hash to the kill ring for a git repository URL at a
;;   given tag.

;;   Reads your mind to get the default URL: prefers the URL at point,
;;   falls back to the URL following `(url "' in the `defun' at point, or
;;   as a last resort, uses the next match in the buffer for
;;   `goto-address-url-regexp'.


;; `M-x' `guix-packaging-go-mod-to-checklist-dwim'
;; ───────────────────────────────────────────────

;;   Turns go module definitions into an org/markdown checklist, suitable
;;   to keep track of packaging progress.


;; `M-x' `guix-packaging-go-mod-to-checkbox'
;; ─────────────────────────────────────────

;;   Replace a single go module definition with a checkbox.

;; `M-x' `guix-packaging-refresh-packages'
;; ───────────────────────────────────────

;;   Refresh the cache of information about available Guix packages.


;; Snippets
;; ════════

;; scheme mode
;; ───────────

;;   The `guix-go' snippet creates the skeleton of a go module package and
;;   assists you in quickly filling it out. You first provide the import
;;   path, from which the snippet infers the symbol & package names, the
;;   repo URL, the hash, and the homepage. All of these are presented in
;;   the snippet as default values that you can change as you go for
;;   unusual cases.

;;   The `guix-go-noversion' snippet is similar but instead provides a
;;   package skeleton suitable for those modules which don't have any
;;   releases.


;; sgml, web, markdown, and org modes
;; ──────────────────────────────────

;;   The `guix-badge' snippet inserts the HTML for a Repology badge showing
;;   the package status in Guix and linking to the project page in
;;   Repology, handy for project status pages.


;; text mode
;; ─────────

;;   The `guix-issue-url' snippet inserts a URL pointing to the Guix issue
;;   tracker.
